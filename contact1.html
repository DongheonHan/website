    <p>Recently, due to the development of IT convergence technology, the environmental implantation sensor technology, and the low cost of controllers, the autonomous vehicle industries are rapidly developing. This study develops a path tracking algorithm based on autonomous steering control technology, which is one of the core technologies among autonomous driving technologies. </p>
    <p>In order to develop a path tracking algorithm, the kinematic state (including the position coordinates, the heading angle, and the steering angle) of the vehicle was updated using a two-dimensional bicycle model (figure 1 left), which is simplified modeling of the lateral movement of the vehicle. The desired path was created based on the waypoints, and the head angle and the distance of the tractor from the desired path were used as errors (figure 1 right).</p>

    <p>For higher productivity and easier accessibility, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was used to implement a high-level control of a tractor. A tractor's path tracking algorithm consists of 4 steps (figure 2). </p>
    <p>First, the initial position of the tractor and boundary conditions are initialized (orange line). Second, to establish a realistic steering and accelerating scenario, steering and speed delays (time delay occurs in the system due to the mechanical properties of the tractor) were applied in the algorithm (yellow line). Third, path tracking was conducted by using head angle and distance error's P control, and tractor's speed and steering angle at that moment were estimated (blue line). Fourth, by using steering angle and speed, the vehicle's updated position and head angle were calculated. If the tractor arrives in the target range, the loop breaks, and the program would be terminated (purple line).</p>

    <p>The path tracking algorithm has the disadvantage that it cannot perfectly reflect the actual steering and accelerating scenario. That is why the delay was included in the algorithm. Steering and acceleration delays caused a dynamic variation in the magnitude of the error vector. Therefore, dynamic target control was required, and the size of the target was modified depending on the vehicle's position.</p>
    <p>The algorithm has been completely implemented in both MATLAB and C++, and the path tracking algorithm is currently being tested to find the optimized target radii (figure 1 right) and optimized gains (P control). Currently, the target radius is being optimized by using the Machine Learning method to change the target radius dynamically according to different situations.</p>
    
    <p>Figure 3 displays the waypoints that were used in the experiment to show the newly developed algorithm's performance. The video shows an efficient path tracking of the algorithm, based on the result of the experiment. A steering delay of 0.1 was used and target radii of 3m and 6m were applied in the experiment.</p>
